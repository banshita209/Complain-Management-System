# Complain-Management-System
PHP project

So through this project will would to create a platform where student can share their problem and complain with the institute
One of the most important feature of this project is to hide the identity of the student.
But the identity of the student will be remain hidden until he/she does not use abusive words and make a false complain
So through this we will try to maintain things in order and make sure that student does not misuse their power


There are three main user : Admin, Student and Department
Admin will maintain all the user and always make sure that every problem or complain reaches to the respective department
Student will register themselves and their will share their problems and complains here.
Department will view the complains that are received from the student side and will take appropriate action to solve that problem.

#OBJECTIVES
